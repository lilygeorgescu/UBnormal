We present an abnormal video in the left side (the anomalous regions are emphasised with red contour) and in the right side we present a normal video from UBnormal data set.

### Description
UBnormal is new supervised open-set benchmark composed of multiple virtual scenes for video anomaly detection. Unlike existing data sets, we introduce abnormal events annotated at the pixel level at training time, for the first time enabling the use of fully-supervised learning methods for abnormal event detection. To preserve the typical open-set formulation, we make sure to include disjoint sets of anomaly types in our training and test collections of videos.

Examples of actions from our data set:
